## Usage

To use the prediction system, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the application's user interface.

To get a prediction, follow these steps:

1.  Enter 60 numerical values, separated by commas, into the text input field.
2.  Click the "Predict" button.
3.  The application will display the prediction, indicating whether the object is a "Rock" or a "Mine".

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

-   `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file that provides the user interface for the prediction system.
-   `model.pkl`: A serialized file containing the pre-trained logistic regression model.
-   `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
